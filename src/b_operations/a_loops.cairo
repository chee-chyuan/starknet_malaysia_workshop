# Loops (for, while) are something that we are familiar with in our traditional coding language
# However things doesnt work quite the same in Cairo. The unusualness often leads to
# people agreeing that Cairo is hard to learn.
# Cairo uses a slightly different way of writing loops (https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_cairo/intro.html#recursion-instead-of-loops)
# The reason why Cairo does this is not to make our lifes difficult, rather it is due to
# how the lower level operations work in Cairo. We will not go through
# the lower level stuff here, perhaps in some future more advance tutorial
